# Remote Robotics Learning System (RRLS)
The Remote Robotic Learning System is a system which aims to enable remote mentoring and support to students looking to learn robotics remotely. 

# Problem Definition and Context
I have a background in robotics and embedded systems education. Robotics and embedded electronics have a steep learning curve with a range of subject matter. I identified the complexity of delivering this content and facilitating projects effectively. The key painpoints were:
- Teachers tend to have limited technical exposure to deliver content
- Teachers also tend to teach in a manner which is instruction based where project based learning is better suited
- Student engagement/motivation is largely dependant on teacher
