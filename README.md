# Remote Robotics Learning System (RRLS)
The Remote Robotic Learning System is a system which aims to enable remote mentoring and support to students looking to learn robotics remotely. 

# Problem Definition and Context
I have a background in robotics and embedded systems education. Robotics and embedded electronics have a steep learning curve with a range of subject matter. I identified the complexity of delivering this content and facilitating projects effectively. The key painpoints were:
- Teachers tend to have limited technical exposure to deliver content
- Teachers also tend to teach in a manner which is instruction based where project based learning is better suited
- Student engagement/motivation is largely dependant on teacher

# System Architecture
System architecture of the system can be observed:

There are 4 fundamental sub-systems and 2 user groups. Users are a student which interacts with a learning device writing code, connecting peripheralsand getting feedback via a user interface. This feedback is delivered by the mentor, based on an assessment of the circuit based on analog readings of pins, sensor readings, modes of operation and pins peripheral connect with

# User Interface

The user interface provides feedback to a student. Visual, representative feedback is provided in an engaging manner to promote students acting on issues raised by mentor. This is better visualised in the live demo which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/swithers19/RRLS-Interface/docs/SystemDemo.mov.
